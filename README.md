I have completed two machine learning projects and uploaded them to this GitHub repository.
The first project is a Breast Cancer Classification model, which leverages various machine learning algorithms to accurately classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on a dataset of breast cancer cases.
The second project is a Titanic Survival Prediction model, which predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using a range of features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.
Both projects include detailed notebooks with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights.
Feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions.
